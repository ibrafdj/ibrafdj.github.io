      <description>Hello there! I started blogging back when I was in high school in 2015 by writing short fictional stories for my very first blog&#xD;(I was young and dumb; please be nice). But this hobby died out pretty soon as I graduated high school and entered college.&#xA;Flash forward to 2020, when a pandemic struck the world, and for a while, everyone just stayed in peace and quiet at home.</description>

      <description>I have never watched a single Korean drama series before Crash Landing on You.&#xA;That sums up pretty much all the qualifications that I have in writing this review. I have no prior knowledge of any K-drama tropes, character archetypes, culture, etc. This gives me an outside look and a fresh new perspective of this widely-acclaimed series. A perspective that I am willing to share in this spoiler-free review of Crash Landing on You!</description>
