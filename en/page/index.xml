      <description>Hello there! I started blogging back when I was in high school in 2015 by writing short fictional stories for my very first blog(I was young and dumb; please be nice). But this hobby died out pretty soon as I graduated high school and entered college.
Flash forward to 2020, when a pandemic struck the world, and for a while, everyone just stayed in peace and quiet at home.</description>
