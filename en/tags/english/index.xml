      <description>Hello there! I started blogging back when I was in high school in 2015 by writing short fictional stories for my very first blog(I was young and dumb, please be nice). But this hobby died out pretty soon as I graduated high school and entered college.
Flash forward to 2020, a time when a pandemic struck the world and for a while, everyone just stayed in peace and quiet at home.</description>

      <description>I have never watched a single Korean drama series before Crash Landing on You.
That sums up pretty much all the qualifications that I have in writing this review. I have no prior knowledge of any K-drama tropes, character archetypes, culture, etc. This gives me an outside look and a fresh new perspective of this widely-acclaimed series. A perspective that I am willing to share in this spoiler-free review of Crash Landing on You!</description>
